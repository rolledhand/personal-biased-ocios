# authored-DRTs

Authored OCIO display rendering views built around OpenDRT v1.1, with a lean set of supporting camera/log spaces and selected JP2499DRT looks.

This repository is intended as a practical creative display config rather than a complete color-management distribution. It keeps the working surface small, the view menu readable, and the custom looks easy to test in real grading, comp, and look-development work.

## What This Is

`authored-DRTs` contains a slim OCIO v2 config centered on:

- OpenDRT v1.1 display rendering views
- Custom authored OpenDRT variants
- A retained set of JP2499DRT looks
- Common camera/log input spaces
- ACES interchange spaces
- Texture/data utility spaces

The config is currently built for a Rec.2020 scene-linear working space and exposes display views for:

- sRGB
- Display P3
- Rec.1886
- Log utility views

## Included Config

Use:

```text
config-2020.ocio
```

The active display-rendering views are intentionally curated. The current OpenDRT-facing view order starts with the Flawed Emulsion family, then Bleached, Gentle Touch, Shifted Crisp, OpenDRT Standard, and the retained JP2499DRT views.

## Authored Display Responses

All views in this section are intentionally authored display responses rather than neutral technical transforms. The descriptions below summarize the intended image character of each one.

`Bleached` uses a D55-oriented response. `Gentle Touch` uses a D50-oriented response. `Flawed Emulsion`, `Shifted Crisp`, and `OpenDRT Standard` use D65-oriented responses.

### Flawed Emulsion

A D65 photographic response with dense color separation, imperfect neutrality, and a deliberately unstable emulsion character.

### Flawed Emulsion - Mineral Fade

A restrained atmospheric variant with oxidized aqua and green lower values and warmer aged highlights.

### Flawed Emulsion - Chemical Veil

A darker, denser variant with cool shadow structure, controlled warm upper values, and a chemically contaminated feel.

### Flawed Emulsion - Spilled

The most explosive variant. Bright, saturated, blue and purple biased, with deliberately unstable color behavior.

### Flawed Emulsion 2

An experimental alternate base response with stronger chromatic separation and more scene-dependent behavior.

### Bleached

A D55 response with harder separation, firmer contrast, and a more processed print character.

### Bleached - Negative Print

A forceful negative-print interpretation with increased density, stronger contrast, and a cool magenta bias.

### Bleached - Oxide Residue

An extreme chemical variant with heavy blue separation, disrupted green and yellow relationships, and aggressive chromatic density.

### Gentle Touch

A D50 response with softer highlight handling, gentler tonal compression, and a warmer, more forgiving photographic character.

### Gentle Touch - Negative Print

The Negative Print treatment filtered through the softer Gentle Touch base response.

### Gentle Touch - Surreal Push

An aggressive stylized response with strong blue displacement, elevated saturation, and deliberately surreal tonal behavior.

### Shifted Crisp

A D65 response designed as a more authored and immediately finished-looking alternative to a standard neutral base DRT. It remains comparatively controlled, but uses firmer separation, cleaner tonal organization, and a deliberate overall image bias.

### OpenDRT Standard

The D65 OpenDRT reference response, retained as the baseline for comparison with the authored views.

`OpenDRT Standard` keeps the OpenDRT name explicitly because it is the reference/base view. Custom variants omit the `OpenDRT` prefix in the visible view name to keep menus cleaner.

## Retained JP2499DRT Views

The config also keeps a selected JP2499DRT section:

- `JP2499DRT`
- `JP2499DRT - Editorial Split`
- `JP2499DRT - Hard Contrast`
- `JP2499DRT - Photochemical`
- `JP2499DRT - Chemical Drift`
- `JP2499DRT - Tarnished Print`
- `JP2499DRT - Graphite Matte`
- `JP2499DRT - Soot`
- `JP2499DRT - Carbon Plate`
- `JP2499DRT - Carbon Black`
- `JP2499DRT - Blue Carbon Print`
- `JP2499DRT - Funeral Bronze`
- `JP2499DRT - Phoenix Drift`

Older STP LUT definitions are intentionally kept in the config for compatibility and future reference, even when not exposed as active views.

## Installing

Point your application to the OCIO config:

```sh
export OCIO=/path/to/authored-DRTs/config-2020.ocio
```

Or choose `config-2020.ocio` directly in applications that provide an OCIO config picker.

The config has been tested during development with OCIO-aware tools such as Nuke and other DCC/grading applications, but behavior can vary by host application.

## Validation

After editing the config, validate it with:

```sh
ociocheck --iconfig /path/to/authored-DRTs/config-2020.ocio
```

Recommended sanity checks:

- All referenced LUT files resolve from the configured search path.
- All active displays and views build processors.
- OpenDRT variants use the intended OpenDRT v1.1 display-target LUTs.
- No display transform is added after a final OpenDRT display LUT.
- Custom OpenDRT grading transforms occur before the final display LUT.

## Authoring Notes

The custom OpenDRT looks are authored as display-rendering variants, not generic looks layered after display output. Their creative transforms are placed before the matching final OpenDRT display LUT.

For OpenDRT variants:

- Do not chain multiple DRT LUTs.
- Do not add sRGB, Display P3, Rec.1886, gamma, or other display transforms after the final OpenDRT LUT.
- If adding scene-linear CDL work, wrap only that section in the intended scene-linear space and return to the display-rendering path before the final LUT.

## Status

This is a personal authored DRT config. Expect changes as looks are tested, renamed, hidden, or removed.

The goal is not to preserve every experiment. The goal is a small, useful set of authored display responses that feel intentional.
